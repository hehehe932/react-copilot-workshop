## How Copilot Reads Your Code

Before suggesting anything, Copilot reads:
- The file you are currently in
- The function names and variable names it can see
- The imports at the top of your file
- The comment you just wrote

This means **context matters**. If you are in `App.jsx` and Copilot can see `const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(...)`, your prompts about tasks will be much more accurate.

## 🟢 BEGINNER PROMPTS

These work well for Tier 1 features.

---

### Prompt 1 — Filter tasks to show only Pending
```jsx
// Filter the tasks array to only include tasks where status is 'Pending'
// Store the result in pendingTasks
```
**Why it works:** Short, specific, names the variable. Copilot knows `tasks` is in scope.

---

### Prompt 2 — Count completed tasks
```jsx
// Calculate doneCount as the number of tasks where status equals 'Done'
```
**Why it works:** Clear goal, uses the exact string value ('Done') that matches your data.

---

### Prompt 3 — Handle Enter key on input
```jsx
// Handle keyDown event on the input
// If event.key is 'Enter', call the onAdd function
```
**Why it works:** Names the event type, specifies the key, names the function to call.

---

### Prompt 4 — Show a count of total vs done
```jsx
// Show '{doneCount} of {totalCount} tasks complete' as a paragraph
```
**Why it works:** Template literals in the comment help Copilot match your variable names.

---

### Prompt 5 — Add conditional className to a div
```jsx
// Add a className to the task card div
// 'task-card--pending' if status is 'Pending', 'task-card--done' if status is 'Done'
```
**Why it works:** Naming both class names gives Copilot the full picture.

---

### Prompt 6 — Create a simple badge component
```jsx
// PriorityBadge component
// Receives: priority prop — 'high', 'medium', or 'low'
// Returns: a <span> with className 'priority-{priority}' and the priority label
```
**Why it works:** Describes input, output, and the naming pattern for the class.

---

### Prompt 7 — Show/hide an empty state message
```jsx
// If tasks.length is 0, show a paragraph 'No tasks yet. Add one above!'
// Otherwise, render the task list
```
**Why it works:** Copilot understands the conditional pattern — it will write the ternary or if/else.

---

### Prompt 8 — Controlled input with state
```jsx
// Controlled text input
// value equals newTask state
// onChange calls setNewTask with the input's current value
```
**Why it works:** Names the exact state variable, describes the event handler pattern.

---

### Prompt 9 — Button with dynamic label
```jsx
// Button that shows 'Undo' if task.status is 'Done', otherwise shows 'Done'
```
**Why it works:** Exact condition, exact label text — Copilot writes the ternary for you.

---

### Prompt 10 — Display pluralized text
```jsx
// Show '{pendingCount} task remaining' when count is 1
// Show '{pendingCount} tasks remaining' when count is not 1
```
**Why it works:** Describes the pluralization rule explicitly.

---

## 🟡 INTERMEDIATE PROMPTS

These work well for Tier 2 features.

---

### Prompt 11 — Filter tasks by search term
```jsx
// Filter tasks where the title includes searchTerm
// Make the comparison case-insensitive using toLowerCase()
// Store the result in filteredTasks
```
**Why it works:** Specifies the method to use (`toLowerCase`) and the variable name.

---

### Prompt 12 — Category filter tabs
```jsx
// Render three buttons: 'All', 'Pending', 'Done'
// Each button calls setFilter with its own label
// The active button (where label equals filter state) gets className 'tab--active'
```
**Why it works:** Describes all three buttons, the handler, and the active state condition.

---

### Prompt 13 — Filter tasks by active tab
```jsx
// If filter is 'All', show all tasks
// If filter is 'Pending', show only tasks where status is 'Pending'
// If filter is 'Done', show only tasks where status is 'Done'
// Store the result in displayedTasks
```
**Why it works:** All three cases are described. Copilot will generate clean conditional logic.

---

### Prompt 14 — Toggle editing mode for a task
```jsx
// When the Edit button is clicked, set editingId to task.id
// When editingId equals task.id, show an input with the task title
// Otherwise show the title as text
```
**Why it works:** Describes both the trigger and the conditional render logic.

---

### Prompt 15 — Save an edited task title
```jsx
// handleEditTask function receives id and newTitle
// Updates the task in tasks array where id matches
// Sets the title to newTitle
// Uses setTasks and tasks.map
```
**Why it works:** Names the function, parameters, and the exact array method to use.

---

### Prompt 16 — Cancel editing on Escape key
```jsx
// If the user presses the Escape key while editing a task title
// Cancel the edit by setting editingId back to null
```
**Why it works:** Names the key, names the state, and describes the desired outcome.

---

### Prompt 17 — Combine search and filter
```jsx
// Apply both searchTerm and filter together
// First filter by status (based on filter state)
// Then filter by title (based on searchTerm)
// Chain the two filter calls
```
**Why it works:** Explains the order of operations — Copilot will chain the filters correctly.

---

### Prompt 18 — Show result count after filtering
```jsx
// Show a message like 'Showing 3 tasks' below the filter tabs
// Use the length of filteredTasks
```
**Why it works:** Names the source variable and shows the exact message format.

---

### Prompt 19 — Sort tasks by priority
```jsx
// Sort the tasks array so high priority tasks appear first, then medium, then low
// Create a priority order object: { high: 0, medium: 1, low: 2 }
// Use Array.sort with that order
```
**Why it works:** Gives Copilot the sorting strategy explicitly — it will implement it precisely.

---

### Prompt 20 — Highlight overdue tasks
```jsx
// If task.dueDate exists and is earlier than today's date
// Add the className 'task-card--overdue' to the task card
```
**Why it works:** Describes the condition and the class name. Copilot knows how to compare dates.

---

## 🔴 ADVANCED PROMPTS

These work well for Tier 3 features.

---

### Prompt 21 — Load from localStorage on mount
```jsx
// On component mount, load tasks from localStorage
// The key is 'workshop-tasks'
// Use JSON.parse to convert the string back to an array
// If nothing is stored, fall back to sampleTasks
```
**Why it works:** Names the key, the parsing method, and the fallback. Copilot writes the useEffect.

---

### Prompt 22 — Save to localStorage when tasks change
```jsx
// Whenever the tasks array changes, save it to localStorage
// The key is 'workshop-tasks'
// Use JSON.stringify to convert the array to a string
// Use useEffect with [tasks] as the dependency array
```
**Why it works:** All four details (key, method, trigger, dependency) are explicit.

---

### Prompt 23 — Dark mode class on root div
```jsx
// Add className 'dark' to the root app div when darkMode state is true
// Use a template literal or ternary to conditionally add the class
```
**Why it works:** Describes the mechanism, not just the goal.

---

### Prompt 24 — Dark mode toggle button
```jsx
// A button that shows '🌙 Dark' when darkMode is false
// And '☀️ Light' when darkMode is true
// Clicking it calls onToggleDark
```
**Why it works:** Both states and both labels are described — no ambiguity.

---

### Prompt 25 — Save dark mode preference to localStorage
```jsx
// Save the darkMode boolean to localStorage with key 'workshop-dark-mode'
// Load it on mount and use it to set the initial darkMode state
```
**Why it works:** Names the key, the type (boolean), and describes both save and load.

---

### Prompt 26 — Progress bar fill width
```jsx
// Calculate percentage as (doneCount / totalCount) * 100
// If totalCount is 0, percentage should be 0 (avoid dividing by zero)
// Set the width of the progress bar fill div to that percentage using inline style
```
**Why it works:** Handles the edge case (zero tasks), describes the inline style pattern.

---

### Prompt 27 — Celebration message at 100%
```jsx
// If all tasks are done (percentage === 100 and totalCount > 0)
// Show a paragraph '🎉 All tasks complete! Amazing work!'
// Otherwise show the normal progress percentage text
```
**Why it works:** Both conditions for the celebration case are specified.

---

### Prompt 28 — useEffect with multiple dependencies
```jsx
// Run a useEffect whenever tasks or filter changes
// Log to the console: 'Tasks or filter updated'
```
**Why it works:** Specifies both dependencies. Useful for debugging.

---

### Prompt 29 — Copy task list to clipboard
```jsx
// When the Export button is clicked
// Create a text string with each task title on its own line
// Copy it to the clipboard using navigator.clipboard.writeText
// Show an alert saying 'Tasks copied to clipboard!'
```
**Why it works:** Describes the Web API method and the feedback to give the user.

---

### Prompt 30 — Add a confetti animation on completion
```jsx
// When pendingCount reaches 0 and tasks.length is greater than 0
// Show a full-width banner div with className 'all-done-banner'
// Display the text '🎉 You finished everything! Great work today.'
// The banner should only appear while the condition is true
```
**Why it works:** Specifies the trigger condition, the element, the class, and the message.

## 🤖 BEYOND AUTOCOMPLETE: CO-PILOT AGENT MODE & WORKFLOWS

VS Code + GitHub Copilot has evolved from standard code autocompletions to a full **Coding Agent** that can execute complex, multi-step operations. Here are the tools and features you should know:

### 1. Copilot Agent Mode (`@workspace /agent`)
Instead of generating single lines, Agent Mode scans your active files and folders, plans changes, modifies multiple files at once, runs local scripts, and self-corrects based on compiler errors.
*   **How to trigger:** Open the Copilot Chat Panel (Sidebar) and toggle **Agent Mode** on, or prepend `@workspace /agent` to your query.
*   **Try this prompt:**
    > `@workspace Analyze this React project, check for any CSS class inconsistencies, and list them with recommended fixes.`

### 2. Browser Control & MCP Tools
Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Copilot can plug into local environment interfaces like database connectors or browser automation frameworks (e.g. Playwright). This allows the agent to open a local page, click UI buttons, verify features, and capture screenshots.
*   **Try this prompt:**
    > `Open http://localhost:5173 in the browser, test the Add Task and Delete buttons, and report any failures.`

### 3. Project-Wide Instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
You can define specific coding rules, styles, framework version guidelines, and naming conventions globally. Copilot automatically parses this file on every chat prompt or inline autocomplete request in the repo.
*   **Example content:**
    ```markdown
    Always use functional components in React.
    Keep state mutations immutable using array methods like map/filter/spread.
    Explain changes in simple, beginner-friendly terms.
    ```

### 4. Code & PR Review Agent
You can ask Copilot to review code or pull requests directly, either locally or within GitHub.com. It reads your changes and suggests optimizations for performance, styling, or bug fixes.
*   **Try this prompt:**
    ```txt
    Review this TaskCard component and suggest optimizations for rendering performance.
    ```

### 5. Git Commit Sparkle
In the VS Code Source Control panel, after staging your files, click the **Sparkle (generate commit message)** icon in the commit text area. Copilot will automatically analyze your code changes and write a descriptive, standardized commit message.

### 6. Cloud Tasks & TODOs
If you write a comment beginning with `// TODO:`, VS Code provides a Code Action to delegate it to a Copilot Cloud Agent. The agent runs in a secure cloud environment, completes the task, tests it, and opens a GitHub Pull Request for you.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Comment first, code second.** Always write what you want before you start typing code.
2. **Be specific.** "Add a button" → bad. "Add a button with className 'btn-delete' that calls onDelete(task.id) when clicked" → good.
3. **Name your variables.** Mention variable names from your file. Copilot will use them.
4. **Read every suggestion.** Tab accepts. Read it, understand it, then accept.
5. **You are the developer.** Copilot is the tool. If the suggestion is wrong, reject it and re-prompt.
